# 🟢 PHASE 1: ABSOLUTE BASICS (FOUNDATION)

This phase focuses on **conceptual clarity**.  
Before writing any code, it is critical to understand **what LangChain is, what it is not, and how its core concepts fit into a real-world application**.

## What LangChain Is

LangChain is an **orchestration framework for Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

It helps developers:
- Structure and manage prompts
- Connect LLMs to external data sources
- Integrate tools and APIs
- Build multi-step reasoning workflows
- Control execution flow and state
- Create agent-like systems in a structured way

LangChain is best viewed as the **application logic layer** for LLM-powered systems.

## What LangChain Is NOT

LangChain is **not**:
- An LLM or model provider
- A frontend framework
- A database or vector store
- A hosting or deployment platform
- A “one-click” AI agent builder

LangChain does **not**:
- Guarantee correct or factual outputs
- Automatically make applications production-ready
- Replace backend or infrastructure engineering

LangChain **organizes LLM usage** — it does not replace system design.

## LangChain Mental Model

A simple and accurate mental model:
